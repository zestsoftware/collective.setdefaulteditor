Changelog
=========

1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- When there are many users (site_properties/many_users) try to get
  all members by searching for a login with 'a', then 'b', etc.  Not
  ideal, but if for example LDAP gives problems because it returns too
  many results (which means it does not actually return anything) then
  this may help.
